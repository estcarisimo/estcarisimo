I have created a utility leveraging CAIDA's [PYIPMeta](https://github.com/CAIDA/pyipmeta) and the [RouteViews prefix-to-AS snapshots](https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/routeviews-prefix2as/) to simplify the process of mapping IP addresses to Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). The project is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed at this [repository](https://github.com/estcarisimo/map-ip-to-asn).
